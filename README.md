# Eclipse-Build-Option-Plugin
This plugin enhances the existing launchers with more build options.

## Features
- Enhance the M2E Launcher with a toggle to disable auto build due to workspace refresh while running a maven goal. This might be useful for goals which result is generating code which doesn't require the eclipse builder to kick in.
